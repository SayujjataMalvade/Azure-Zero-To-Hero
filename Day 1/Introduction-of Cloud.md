- **What is Cloud?**
- For that we have to travel 15 years behind were Companies buy server from another company and deploy one application on that server suppose we want to deploy another application we need to buy another server this was wastage of CPU's storage, maintenance of Server required a lot of cost and if your Server will get impacted by nature disaster then all data will be lost. 
- To overcome this Virtualization concept come to picture, for example if you are using Windows machine and you want to work on Linux machine for that you have to download VM box on your local windows machine and you storage is also get minimum resulting slowing down of your local machine. 
- So hence Cloud technology comes in picture with **Pay-as-you-go** pricing model where you have to pay for whatever you are going to use. You don't have to maintain server ,investment of huge cost for servers. So cloud is more popular in last 5-7 years.
